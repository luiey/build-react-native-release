# build-react-native-release
A batch file that will assist in creating the APK or AAB file.

I'm using this batch file to build my project at ease.

Download the batch file and place outside of targetted project folder to be build. For example let's say your project path is on C:\ReactNative\My-Target-Project. Place the batch file on C:\ReactNative\build-react-native-release.bat.

Double click the file, UAC will require administration access. Batch will listing all folder in the running directory. Enter the folder name, and press ENTER.

It will build the android bundle and so on, and it will ask for output whether you want to build as APK for manual installation or AAB for Google Play upload.

On complete build, it will also open the final folder so you can copy out the final file for your usage.

I build and use it in expected directory with react-native project. So, it you want to test will more handling, you can modify and do it your self.

Enjoy your build!
